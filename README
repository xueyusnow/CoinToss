ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1: The outside code resources we will be allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written by the course staff for the purpose of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this course.

2: Two heads and two tails are both 25% and one head and one tail is 50%. Because the percentage of that the first outcome is one head and the second outcome is one tail is 25%. And the percentage of that the first outcome is one tail and the second outcome is one head is 25%. Both the situation can be seen as one head and one tail. So the percentage of one head and one tail is 50%.

3: About 2500.

4: The avaliable largest number of trials is 2,147,483,647 and the number where it overflowed is 2,147,483,648.
